    <h2><u>A Study of Gentrification</u></h2>

    <h3><u>Introduction</u></h3>

    <p>
        Gentrification is a phenomenon in which the rising price of housing displaces indigenous communities. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Put shortly, this results in segregation. As the price of housing rises,
        wealthy people from privileged backgrounds are given exclusive access to desirable neighborhoods,
        increasing demand for housing while lowering supply. Disadvantaged people are then dislocated
        and forced to move to less desirable and more affordable areas that aren’t as ripe with economic opportunity.
        This causes feedback loops in which crime increases and businesses close,
        dooming people to live in these areas that are colloquially identified as ghettos.
    </p>

    <h3><u>Background</u></h3>

    <p>
        The purpose of this study is to observe the variability in the price of housing,
        as well as other data fields that may be potential factors or externalities.
        The independent analyses will be done as functions of time so that anomalies 
        may be identified and contextualized by historical occurrences.
        Comparisons will then be done accordingly.
    </p>

    <dt>
        The scope of this study will be restricted to the five counties of New York City:
    </dt>

    <dd>
        <ul>
            <li>Queens County, the borough of Queens</li>
            <li>Bronx County, the borough of The Bronx</li>
            <li>Kings County, also known as the Borough of Brooklyn</li>
            <li>New York County, also known as the Borough of Manhattan</li>
            <li>Richmond County, also known as the Borough of Staten Island</li>
        </ul>
    </dd>

    <dt>
        The data that will be observed and analyzed consists of:
    </dt>
    
    <dd>
        <ol>
            <li>General Rent Data</li>
            <li>House Price Data</li>
            <li>Race / Ethnic Data</li>
            <li>Crime Data</li>
            <li>Salary Data</li>
            <li>Employment Data</li>
        </ol>
    </dd>
        
    <h3><u>Contextualizing The Data</u></h3>

    <p>
        The time period studied will be the years 2006 through 2019, the datasets each span
        different periods of time and this range is one they each have in common,
        with exception to Manhattan’s Housing Price Index (HPI) data from the years 2016 onwards.
        For reasons later described, this will not have an effect on the study.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Financial Crisis and Hurricane Sandy are two significant phenomena
        that can justify the anomalous behavior that takes place in 2008 and 2013
        respectively. If the scope were to be expanded, it would be reasonable to
        expect the Tech Bubble and the 9/11 terrorist attack to also have significant and visible impacts on the data.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Covid-19 pandemic, and government reaction to it, has had immense influence on
        the any available data and has rendered it mostly useless for this analysis. Therefore,
        data collected after 2019 will be discarded or dismissed. There are however, interesting
        observations that can be made studying the impact of an absolute welfare state on life in New York City.
    </p>

    <p>
        Inflation is a significant factor that makes it very difficult to make immediate
        comparisons, therefore it is critical to frame the data and analysis in a manner
        such that inflation distorts the information minimally. This means that comparisons
        between datasets should only be made within that same year, and overarching conclusions
        should only be made after financial data is normalized in respect to inflation.
    </p>

    <p>
        Relative Population is another important factor that distorts data that is presented in
        a manner that portrays total occurrences. Therefore it is important to convert that data
        so that it is quantified per capita when making direct comparisons. Staten Island’s population
        is approximately a third of the size of the next least populated county,
        suggesting comparisons will be difficult to make and possibly inconclusive.

    <h3><u>Initial Observations</u></h3>

    <P>
        Staten Island seems to be incredibly anomalous, featuring both lower earnings and lower crime.
        This radical difference can most likely be attributed to the difference in population size.
        One may wonder if this data is more comparable to that of New Jersey’s counties rather than
        other boroughs in New York City. Due to this stark difference in data, Richmond County will be excluded from further analysis.
    </P>

    <p>
        Manhattan is interesting in that it is home to the highest earning New Yorkers, has the most
        expensive housing, and employs the most people despite ranking third among the counties in terms
        of population. This may be explained anecdotally rather than analytically. Manhattan is better
        suited for business fronts rather than housing, as seen with Broadway and Wallstreet, leading
        one to view Manhattan as an epicenter of business and commerce rather than an independent and
        isolated environment that could be directly compared to its neighboring counties. A significant
        extrapolation, assuming this line of reasoning is correct, is that the employment opportunities
        available in Manhattan are shared by the surrounding counties. While important in contextualizing
        the socio-economic dynamic of gentrification, outside of being described as “very expensive and unattainable”
        there is little more information to be understood or observed in respect to Manhattan as a residential area. 
    </p>
        
    <p>
        Judging from the preliminary observations, Bronx will be the prime environment for studying the effects of
        gentrification. The substantial shift in its ethnic demographic depict a phenomenon referred to as ‘white
        flight’ with roots that directly relate to the idea of gentrification, crime, and segregation.
